The [elementname]#vaadin-date-picker# element is a date selection field with a scrollable month calendar view.
The user can navigate to a month by scrolling the list of months and select a date.
To quickly jump to the current month, there is a 'today' button.
When a date is selected, the user can clear the value with a button on the right side of the selection.

The current alpha version has a limited set of features.
Future versions will address issues such as localization, easy navigation through years and keyboard input.
