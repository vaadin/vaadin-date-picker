The `vaadin-date-picker` element is a date selection field which includes a scrollable month calendar view.
User can navigate to the correct month by scrolling the list of months and making a selection with mouse or touch device.
After the selection is made, the user can also clear the value with a clear icon that appears after the selection.

Current alpha version has a limited set of features, but future versions will address issues like localization, easy navigation through years and keyboard input.
