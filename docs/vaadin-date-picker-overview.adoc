= Overview

The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# element is a date selection field with a scrollable month calendar view.
The picker opens up as a dropdown when the element gets clicked or tapped.
There's also JavaScript APIs for opening and closing the picker: `datepicker.open()` and `datepicker.close()`.

It has two display modes, full-screen or desktop.
The display mode to use is determined according to the size of the screen.
The user can navigate to a desired month by scrolling the list of years and months and then select a date.
On a desktop browser the input field can also be used for setting the [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# value directly by typing.

When a date is selected, the user can clear the value with a button on the right side of the selection label.
The dropdown footer has a today button for quickly jumping to the current month.
It does not select a date but only scrolls the calendar view.
A cancel button in the footer allows closing the dropdown without affecting the value.
