== Localization

The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# has built-in support for multiple locales.

You can adjust the element to a specific locale with the [propertyname]#locale# property.
The value should be a locale identifier given in the BCP 47 format, such as `en-gb`, `fi`, or `es`.
The date picker supports all the locales supported by the link:http://momentjs.com/[moment.js] library. Please refer to its website for the complete list of supported locales.

Once set, the locale affects how months and dates are displayed in the [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# dropdown.

== Initial Position

When the [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# has no selected value and the dropdown is opened, it automatically scrolls to the current month.
You can make it scroll to another month by setting the [propertyname]#initialPosition# property to a date in that month.
