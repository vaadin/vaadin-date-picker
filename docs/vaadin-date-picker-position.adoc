[[vaadin-date-picker.position]]
= Initial Position

When [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# has no selected value and the dropdown is opened, it automatically scrolls to the current month.
But if [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# has [propertyname]#min# or [propertyname]#max# properties set, it scrolls to the closest allowed date.
You can make it scroll to another month by setting the [propertyname]#initialPosition# property to a date in that month.

When [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# already has a value selected, opening the dropdown always scrolls to the month with the selected date.
