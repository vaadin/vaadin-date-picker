= Week Numbers
The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# can be configured to show week numbers.
It can be enabled by setting the [propertyname]#showWeekNumbers# to `true`, and the [propertyname]#i18n.firstDayOfWeek# to `1`.

Weeks are numerated based on the ISO-8601 standard, so the first week of the year contains 4th of January.
And they are numerated starting on Mondays, hence, the date picker only shows week numbers if the first day of the week is set appropriately.

= Customizing the Input Field

The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker# element allows you to customize the default input field by using  CSS mixins.
If that's not enough, you can also replace the whole input field by using the [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker-light# element.

== Replacing the Input

The [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker-light#  element is a light version of the full [vaadinelement]#vaadin-date-picker#, and it provides only the dropdown functionality.

The custom input element must have a property for the value, which is available for two-way data-binding.
By default it is expected that this property is named [propertyname]#bindValue# to make it compatible with link:https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-input[[elementname]#iron-input#].
You can change the property name with the [propertyname]#attrForValue# property.

In order to create a simple `iron-input`-based date-picker, you can just wrap the input inside the element.
